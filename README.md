Lab exercises
These are the required exercises for this week. Work in groups of two and turn in the same
report for each member of the pair. Remember to put your names on the report, as well as
the link to your groups repository. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend switching to
Eclipse now - using different IDEs makes collaborating with Git more complicated.
The goal for this week is that you are getting comfortable with the basic Git workflow. You’ll
be using Git for your pair programming this semester and include a link to your groups
repository in every report. Git is a very powerful tool, but for this semester we’ll stick to the 8
basic commands: init, remote, clone, add, commit, status, push, pull.
