Lab exercises
The goal for this week is that you are getting comfortable with the basic Git workflow. You’ll
be using Git for your pair programming this semester and include a link to your groups
repository in every report. Git is a very powerful tool, but for this semester we’ll stick to the 8
basic commands: init, remote, clone, add, commit, status, push, pull.
