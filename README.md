The poetic coding dynamic is powerful.
Code poetry is a piece of text that can be read as code and run as a program, but also read as poetry. 
It can be human language poetry that has mathematical elements and codes in it, or a snipped code that aims for elegant expression within severe constraints
â€” much like a haiku or a sonnet.
Poems that are readable for humans and readable by computers are simply beautify because they imply a sort of mutual understanding between humans and our digital devices.
Code poetry is special because it allows for a sort of hybrid expressionism and this creates an artistic link between human emotion and the black mirrors
that we find ourselves constantly drawn to.
